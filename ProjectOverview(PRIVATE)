Overview of my project:

  C++ based programming
  C++ ver. 11 
  Uses the Standard GDI+ Library for graphics

  A win32 application
  Contains toolbar with options to select what shape, or action to do
  Functionality of saving and loading created instances

The project is for Computer Graphics and my work requires a lot of learning outside the given topic so i expect it to be a challenging experience
