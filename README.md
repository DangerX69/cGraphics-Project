Objective: Make a Win32 application with toolbar and selectable options to draw different shapes in a canvas

Planned features:

Line:

 1.Using DDA Algorithm. 
 2.Using Midpoint. 
 3.Using Parameterized technique.


Circle: 

 1.Directly Using equation. 
 2.Using Polar form. 
 3.Using Midpoint Algorithm.


Ellipse: 

 1.Directly Using equation. 
 2.Using Polar form. 
 3.Using Midpoint Algorithm.


curves * Just making curve seemed underwhelming so i decided to make shapes filled with some curves in syllabus: 

 1.Draw a Square/rectangle using Hermitian curve. 
 2.Draw Rectangle/square using Bezier curve. 
 3.5 points Cardinal Spline Curve.


Filling Algorithms: 

 1. Recursive. 
 2. Non Recursive *Note: Filling doesnt work for areas with more than the integer limit pixels.


Clipping: 

 1.Circle Line Clipping. 
 2.Rectangle Line Clipping.


Colors: *can add as many color as needed with 4 lines of code increased for each color currently supports :

 1. Pink.
 2. Green.
 3. Purple.
 4. Black.


Other functionalities include an option to clear the current canvas, save and load canvas and the ability to change the pointer cursor within the context 
of the application window ( Standard Arrow, Cross, or Hand)
